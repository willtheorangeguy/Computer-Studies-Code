# AP Create Performance Task Ideas
- [ ] POS System that replicates the Dairy Queen POS System ([Mockup](https://github.com/willtheorangeguy/Computer-Studies-Code/blob/main/AP%20Performance%20Task/AP%20Create%20Task%20Mockup.pdf))
    - Use Tkinter
    - Create a function for each button, and an if statment, that if two of a certain item are added to the cart, then a coupon is auto-applied.
    - List can be used to store ingredients for each item.
    - There is lots of repetition in the code, which should make it easy to finish in 12 hours.
 - [ ] BMI Face Detection Algorithim
    - Uses AI to detect the height and weight of a person from a picture.
    - From that information uses math to calculate the BMI.
    - Could be too resource heavy for consumer dekstop PCs.
    - Raiting system could be implemented, but it may be too anti-inclusive.
